## 🏗️ Why I Built This

This project is part of my goal to learn React through daily hands-on projects.  
Today’s focus was:

- Working with arrays + state  
- Handling inputs & keyboard events  
- Using effects (for theme + saving data)  
- Adding drag-and-drop interactions  
- Polishing UI for a modern feel
